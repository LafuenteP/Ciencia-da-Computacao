# Problem Solving - Computer Science

üëã **Welcome!** This repository contains a collection of codes and solutions developed by me, **Lafuente Paulino**, during my Computer Science studies at Uuniversidade Federal do Cear√° - Campus Quixad√°.

Here, I share my answers to various programming challenges, course exercises, and problem-solving questions that arose throughout my classes. This repository serves as a portfolio of my learning and practice, covering a wide range of topics in the field.

## Contents

- **Data Structures**: Implementations and exercises with lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- **Algorithms**: Searching, sorting, recursion, and optimization techniques.
- **Computational Mathematics**: Code involving mathematical logic, linear algebra, and number theory.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Solutions and examples focusing on foundational OOP principles.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the code, make suggestions, and contribute ideas. Each folder or file includes a brief description of the problem addressed, making it easier to understand the context.
